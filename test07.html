<br>Special counsel David Weiss chastised President Biden</br>
as part of the 280-page report for making “gratuitous and wrong” accusations that his long-running investigation was unfair and tainted by politics. 
The president, when pardoning his son last month, had said Hunter Biden was the victim of a “selective” prosecution that was “unfair” and a “miscarriage of justice.”
“Other presidents have pardoned family members, but in doing so, none have taken the occasion as an opportunity to malign the public servants at the Department of Justice based solely on false accusations,”
 Weiss said in the report.<em>“Far from selective, these prosecutions were the embodiment of the equal application of justice –
no matter who you are, or what your last name is,
</em> you are subject to the same laws as everyone else in the United States,” he added.
Los Angeles residents are bracing for further destruction as weather forecasts indicate that winds helping fuel the flames might pick up again.
Three fires continue to blaze. The largest, the Palisades Fire, has burned more than 23,000 acres and remained at 14% contained as of Monday evening.
LA Mayor Karen Bass said <strong>"urgent preparations" are being made in advance of near hurricane-force
</strong> winds predicted to peak on Tuesday.
<u>At least 24 people have died in the fires and 23 others</u> <line> are missing in the Eaton and Palisades fire zones.</line>
